## Project Scope
The primary focus of the project is to address the problem of assessing individuals' creditworthiness with precision using machine learning techniques. The specific tasks and opportunities within this scope include:
 
a. **Credit Score Classification:**
The project aims to solve the challenge of accurately determining an individual's creditworthiness. This involves predicting credit scores based on various financial and personal features. Aligns with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering goals by incorporating machine learning for predictive analytics, a key aspect of data engineering.


b. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Gathering relevant data from the provided Kaggle dataset and ensuring its cleanliness and suitability for model training. Reinforces data engineering skills by emphasizing the importance of data quality, consistency, and preprocessing for effective machine learning.


c. **Feature Engineering:**
Identifying and creating relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's predictive power. Demonstrates the importance of feature selection and engineering in building robust machine learning models, aligning with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering curriculum.


d. **Model Selection, Training, and Fine-Tuning:**
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm, training the model on the prepared dataset, and optimizing its parameters for better performance. Integrates the machine learning component with the educational goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations by emphasizing model selection and optimization.


e. **Evaluation and Validation:**
Rigorously assessing the model's performance and validating its accuracy and reliability. Aligns with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering curriculum by emphasizing the importance of model evaluation and validation for trustworthy machine learning solutions.


f. **Integration with AWS Services:**
Integrating the developed machine learning model with various AWS tools, such as Amazon SageMaker for deployment, S3 for storage, Lambda for serverless computing, Glue for ETL processes and IAM for access management. Provides practical experience with AWS services, aligning with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering program goals.


By addressing these specific problems, tasks, and opportunities, our project aligns with the educational program goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering.


## Domain
**Domain or Industry:** Financial Services, specifically Credit Scoring


The financial services industry, particularly within credit scoring, encompasses a complex network of entities and processes that revolve around lending, risk assessment, and financial decision-making. Within this domain, multiple layers and interconnected stakeholders influence and are impacted by credit scoring models.


**Key Characteristics:**
1. Data-Driven: The financial industry relies heavily on data, and credit scoring is no exception. Lenders assess the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses to make informed lending decisions.


2. Risk Management: Credit scoring is a fundamental aspect of risk management for financial institutions. It helps them evaluate the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans, allowing them to mitigate potential losses.


3. Regulatory Compliance: Financial institutions must adhere to strict regulations and compliance standards when handling customer data and making lending decisions. These regulations vary by region and require careful consideration.


**Challenges:**
1. Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and quality of data is essential for reliable credit scoring models. Incomplete or erroneous data can lead to inaccurate assessments.


2. Model Interpretability: Explainability and transparency in credit scoring models are vital to building trust with both stakeholders and regulators. Complex machine learning models can be challenging to interpret.


3. Overfitting: Preventing models from overfitting the data is a challenge. Models must generalize well to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.


**Opportunities:**
1. Enhanced Efficiency: Machine learning can streamline and automate the credit scoring process, reducing the time and effort required for assessments.


2. Improved Accuracy: Advanced models can provide more accurate credit risk assessments, reducing the likelihood of bad loans and ultimately benefiting both lenders and borrowers.


3. Financial Inclusion: Machine learning can help expand financial inclusion by providing alternative credit scoring methods for individuals or businesses with limited or no credit history.


**Specific Problem/Task:** Developing a machine learning model for credit score classification. The primary goal is to accurately assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, categorizing them into different risk groups, such as high, medium, or low risk.


**Stakeholders:**
1. Financial Institutions: Banks, credit unions, and lending institutions are the primary stakeholders. They benefit from more accurate credit scoring to make better lending decisions and reduce default risks.


2. Borrowers: Individuals and businesses seeking loans will benefit from a fair and accurate credit assessment, potentially leading to better loan terms.


3. Regulatory Authorities: Regulators oversee and enforce compliance in the financial industry. They benefit from transparent, compliant, and fair credit scoring practices.


4. Data Providers: Credit bureaus and data aggregators play a crucial role in providing the data used for credit scoring. Accurate and up-to-date data is essential for model success.


5. Fintech and Alternative Lenders: Non-traditional financial institutions that use innovative methods to assess credit risk may also be interested in advanced credit scoring models to compete effectively.


Understanding the domain's characteristics, challenges, and opportunities, as well as identifying key stakeholders, is essential for developing a machine learning model for credit score classification that aligns with the needs and objectives of all involved parties.
