## Project Scope
The primary focus of the project is to address the problem of assessing individuals' creditworthiness with precision using machine learning techniques. The specific tasks and opportunities within this scope include:
 
a. **Credit Score Classification:**
The project aims to solve the challenge of accurately determining an individual's creditworthiness. This involves predicting credit scores based on various financial and personal features. Aligns with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering goals by incorporating machine learning for predictive analytics, a key aspect of data engineering.


b. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Gathering relevant data from the provided Kaggle dataset and ensuring its cleanliness and suitability for model training. Reinforces data engineering skills by emphasizing the importance of data quality, consistency, and preprocessing for effective machine learning.


c. **Feature Engineering:**
Identifying and creating relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's predictive power. Demonstrates the importance of feature selection and engineering in building robust machine learning models, aligning with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering curriculum.


d. **Model Selection, Training, and Fine-Tuning:**
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm, training the model on the prepared dataset, and optimizing its parameters for better performance. Integrates the machine learning component with the educational goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations by emphasizing model selection and optimization.


e. **Evaluation and Validation:**
Rigorously assessing the model's performance and validating its accuracy and reliability. Aligns with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering curriculum by emphasizing the importance of model evaluation and validation for trustworthy machine learning solutions.


f. **Integration with AWS Services:**
Integrating the developed machine learning model with various AWS tools, such as Amazon SageMaker for deployment, S3 for storage, Lambda for serverless computing, Glue for ETL processes and IAM for access management. Provides practical experience with AWS services, aligning with the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering program goals.


By addressing these specific problems, tasks, and opportunities, our project aligns with the educational program goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data Engineering.
